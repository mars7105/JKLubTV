			If you have already created a database and entered the players you want to play in your tournament, you can create your tournament.<br> A tournament can contain several groups. Each group of the tournament contains the players who play against each other in the round mode (each against each other). <br>Several data are requested when creating the tournament. For example, the start and end date of the tournament and the name of the tournament, which you can think of as you like and will later be displayed as a headline, for example, on the homepage. <br>The names for the individual groups are also requested. Finally, you can add the individual players from their player list to each group. <br>After adding the last player and confirming it, the tournament will be awarded. <br>Now you can make some changes in the "pairing mode", e.g. Change the color distribution or change the round number and of course enter the date for each pairing. <br>After saving and ending the pairing mode, you can now see the tables and possibly even distribute the first points. <br>Do not forget to save at the end of the entries. <br>You can export the tables in:
